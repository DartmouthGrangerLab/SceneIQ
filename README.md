# SceneIQ
Scene image quality public dataset

Images were degraded into four JPEG (ISO-10918) quality levels using [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).

**Online Dataset:**  41600 image ratings were collected via Mechanical Turk.

**Laboratory Dataset:**  Image ratings were collected from 49 participants (35F, ages 18-22) in a controlled laboratory environment at Dartmouth.

Please see the subfolders and the below citations for details.
